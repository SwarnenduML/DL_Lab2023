From C:\Personal\DL_Lab\input_pipeline\dataset_loader.py:253: CounterV2 (from tensorflow.python.data.experimental.ops.counter) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use `tf.data.Dataset.counter(...)` instead.

Training starts

Start of epoch: 0 - Train - loss: 0.69, acc: 0.48, recall: 0.24, precision: 0.46, Val - loss: 0.69, acc: 0.60, recall: 0.36, precision: 0.90, Time: 48.58
Compiled the loaded model, but the compiled metrics have yet to be built. `model.compile_metrics` will be empty until you train or evaluate the model.
