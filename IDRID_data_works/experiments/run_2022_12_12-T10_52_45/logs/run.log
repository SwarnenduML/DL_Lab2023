All basic datasets created
From C:\Personal\DL_Lab\input_pipeline\dataset_loader.py:253: CounterV2 (from tensorflow.python.data.experimental.ops.counter) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use `tf.data.Dataset.counter(...)` instead.

5 out of the last 17 calls to <function Trainer.train_step at 0x0000017130B6A280> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.
